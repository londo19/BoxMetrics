>### Usage <a href="#top" style="font-size:12px">to top</a>
<sub id="use"></sub>


BoxMetric uses a Pie-Menu what can be access via `ctrl + y` by default.<br>
The Pie-Menu works in any viewport and regardless of mode (object|edit).<br>
You can choose from 3 tabs to either
+ add Primitive
+ switch viewport
+ switch workspace

Simply move the mouse over the pill of your choice. The underlaying Sub-Menu will appear right away.<br>
Navigate to the item of your choice and after a last `left mouse` click on the item,<br>
the choosen feature is going to be executed in the viewport the Pie-Menu was called from.

To activate the Object Panel and all its Features you have to be in **OBJECT**- mode.<br>
Move the mouse cursor above any **MESH**- Object and double-click it with your `left mouse` button.<br>It doesn't matter if the choosen object is the current active or selected object.<br>The Object that calls the event becomes the active/ selected object anyhow.<br>
Only if the object is of a proper kind the Object-Panel will show up and you get access.<br>

You can left-click-hold on the Panel's background to drag it around.<br>
You can click, you can use slider/tabs/buttons etc. the Panel will stay active.<br>
